The Crispy Hardware vision is to make hardware debugging easier, faster, and more fun by providing more visibility to low level hardware events in real time. 
</p>
<p>Below you can see live output from one of the first Crispy Hardware tools.  This is a low level UART debug/trace monitor that is alwasy on and sends time-stamped debug messages wirelessly to permanent cloud storage for monitoring and analysis.</p>
<p>You cannot debug what you cannot see.  Always Be Logging.</p>
<p>Use Crispy Hardware tools.  Because your tools should be Crispy, not your hardware.</p>

                        The C.R.I.S.P.Y. Checklist
                    </div>
                    <div class='panel-body'>

<p>Debugging digital hardware design is not the same as debugging software.</p>
<p>You may have very strong software debugging skills. &nbsp;But I have found that those skills assume that the design is behaving as a digital system. &nbsp;If your hardware design has bugs at the analog level it can cause the digital behavior to appear unpredictable. &nbsp;This behavior and can be very frustrating to debug.</p>
<p><span>I want to share a method that I teach and use to reduce this frustration. &nbsp;This is a checklist that y<span>ou</span> can remember using the <span>cutesy</span> mnemonic device 'CRISPY'. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The CRISPY checklist is:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">C</span>locks</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">R</span></strong><span><span>eset</span></span></li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span></strong><span><span>ntegrity</span> of </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>S</strong></span><span><span>ignals</span></span></li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>P</strong></span><span><span>ower</span></span></li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Y</span></strong><span><span>ou</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>As the mnemonic does not list the items in the best order, I will explain each item below in the order I have found most useful. &nbsp;I will also be relatively brief in this post. &nbsp;If y<span>ou</span> have questions about terms I use or tools needed just ask @<span>duppy</span> on twitter #<span>crispyhw</span> tag. &nbsp;If y<span>ou</span> have better solutions or a problem whose fix did not fit into this checklist, <span>pelase</span> share on twitter @<span>duppy</span> #<span>crispyhw</span>. &nbsp;I'll bet somebody out there has an even better checklist than this one.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">P</span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span><span>ower</span></span></span> 
<ul>
<li>Are power and ground shorted?     
<ul>
<li>I had to ask. &nbsp; It is a good habit to "buzz out" all power and ground signals after every circuit mod <strong>before</strong><span>&nbsp;applying p<span>ower</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is your design plugged in?     
<ul>
<li>Seriously. &nbsp;Double check with a volt meter or LED.</li>
<li>If battery powered, is the battery near full? &nbsp;I recommending replacing the battery with a bench supply while debugging.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Are you using too much power?     
<ul>
<li>A good bench supply will tell you how much <strong>average </strong>current is being drawn. &nbsp;The average will catch some but not all issues.</li>
<li><span>Often your micro will boot fine and only fail when y<span>ou</span> start turning on more modules or clocks or driving too many <span>LEDs</span> or motors. &nbsp;The failure level can vary greatly from chip to chip. &nbsp;Use a bench supply when possible during debugging, add extra <span>LEDs</span> on purpose to stress p<span>ower</span>, or write specific firmware to intentionally turn on as many of the <span>micro's</span> internal modules and clocks to stress p<span>ower</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is the resistance of your power cable too high (often because it is too long)?     
<ul>
<li><span>This is more common when <span>breadboarding</span>. &nbsp;Check p<span>ower</span> at the p<span>ower</span> pin of each <span>IC</span>, not at the p<span>ower</span> supply.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you are using a motor, add a diode!     
<ul>
<li>See this great tutorial for <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/Tutorials/HighCurrentLoads#toc4">driving a motor</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Are you using bypass capacitors of the correct value and more importantly placement?     
<ul>
<li><span>Bypass capacitors can be especially tricky because often modern <span>ICs</span> will work fine without them. &nbsp; Until they don't.</span></li>
<li><span>Also, larger is not better with bypass caps and too small doesn't work either. &nbsp;The value and type needed can also change when going from breadboard to <span>PCB</span>.</span></li>
<li><span>When in doubt, y<span>ou</span> can almost never go wrong with using 0.1<span>uF</span> caps near each <span>IC</span> p<span>ower</span> pin and 10<span>uF</span> at the main p<span>ower</span> source. </span> 
<ul>
<li>Very rarely will you need to delve deeper than the above recommendation. &nbsp;If you do, start with these links.     
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.seattlerobotics.org/encoder/jun97/basics.html">Seattle Robotics</a>&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vagrearg.org/content/decoupling"><span><span>vagrearg</span>.<span>org</span></span></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do you have more than one power domain?     
<ul>
<li><span><span>Remeber</span> that a debug or programming cable or connection to a PC may count as your second p<span>ower</span> domain.</span></li>
<li>Are all the power domains on?</li>
<li>What order are the power domains turning on and off?</li>
<li><span>Check for "<span>backdrive</span>". &nbsp;If an output from a powered <span>IC</span> or a pull-up resistor is driving a high input to an <span>IC</span> that is not powered then y<span>ou</span> are <span>backdriving</span> that <span>IC</span>. &nbsp;The <span>backdriven</span> <span>IC's</span> behavior can range from appearing to work as if powered properly to releasing smoke. &nbsp;The releasing smoke behavior is the easy bug to find. &nbsp;The other behaviors are harder. </span> 
<ul>
<li><span>Can someone recommend a good reference for more on <span>backdrive</span>?</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Are you interfacing 3.3V logic to 5V logic?     
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.sparkfun.com"><span><span>Sparkfun</span> </span></a>has some <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/65">tips</a>.</li>
<li><span>Also read the app notes from the <span>Downloads</span> tab on this </span><a href="https://www.adafruit.com"><span><span>adafruit</span> </span></a><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/757">product</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>R</strong><span><span>eset</span></span></span> 
<ul>
<li><span>Once your digital <span>ICs</span> have stable p<span>ower</span>, they still need a good R<span>eset</span> to start working.</span></li>
<li><span>Many <span>ICs</span> have internal P<span>ower</span> On Resets (<span>POR</span>) so y<span>ou</span> may have been lured into skipping this step. &nbsp;Don't ignore it <span>becsause</span> your debug cable needs r<span>eset</span> to work well and it is also often very convenient to r<span>eset</span> your system during testing without having to cycle p<span>ower</span>.</span></li>
<li>Check that any external reset signals are meeting the timing and voltage level requirements.</li>
<li><span>Check that all <span>ICs</span> that take a r<span>eset</span> (whether explicit signal or implicit <span>POR</span>) are getting r<span>eset</span> at the same time. &nbsp; If not, understand the consequences. &nbsp;Recently I work a lot with </span><a href="http://www.electricimp.com">Electric Imp</a>. &nbsp;In these designs it is tempting to 'reset' by removing and re-inserting the Electric Imp card. &nbsp;The problem is that this does not reset the other digital devices that the Imp talks to. &nbsp;Are you having this problem?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>C</strong>locks</span> 
<ul>
<li><span>Even if P<span>ower</span> and R<span>eset</span> are good, your <span>ICs</span> still don't work without a stable clock. &nbsp;Like r<span>eset</span>, many <span>ICs</span> these days have internal <span>oscilators</span> so y<span>ou</span> might have also been lured into skipping this step.</span></li>
<li><span>Read the <span>datasheet</span> and make sure y<span>ou</span> are providing everything necessary for the internal clock to work or your external crystal or oscillator&nbsp;to start up.</span></li>
<li><span>If y<span>ou</span> have multiple <span>ICs</span> with high speed clocks then y<span>ou</span> need to read up on jitter, skew, setup, hold, <span>metastability</span>, transmission line termination techniques, crosstalk, duty cycle, and probably a few other topics.</span></li>
<li><span>I don't mean to scare y<span>ou</span>. &nbsp; If y<span>ou</span> are using <span>Arduino</span> or similar class micro based designs then high-speed clocks are probably not your problem. &nbsp; Learn enough to rule them out as a possible cause and look everywhere else first.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I</strong><span><span>ntegrity</span> of </span><strong>S</strong><span><span>ignals</span></span></span> 
<ul>
<li><span>This is more commonly called "Signal I<span>ntegrity</span>" when y<span>ou</span> aren't trying to make your checklist have a <span>cutesy</span> mnemonic.</span></li>
<li>Know the speed of all your external signals and start with anything faster than 1MHz.</li>
<li>Know which signals are edge vs. level sensitive. &nbsp;Level sensitive signals can look ugly as they change but must be stable around the setup and hold time of the receiving chip. Edge sensitive signals need to have clean changes and may need to be treated as <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>C</strong>locks</span></li>
<li style="vertical-align: sub;">Lookup V<span style="vertical-align: sub; font-size: 80%;">IH</span>, V<span style="vertical-align: sub; font-size: 80%;">IL</span>, V<span style="vertical-align: sub; font-size: 80%;">OH</span>, V<span style="vertical-align: sub; font-size: 80%;">OL</span> , for your chips an understand what they mean.</li>
<li style="vertical-align: sub;">Check both your internal and external pull-up/down resistors. &nbsp; Use a 100K ohm resistor connected to VCC or GND and poke it at your IOs to see whether they are being actively driven, floating, or pulled up/down.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Y</strong>ou</span> 
<ul>
<li><span>Are you <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090605/quotes?item=qt0424789">reading *it* right!</a> ?</span></li>
<li><span>Do your pin numbers defined in your firmware match the schematic?</span></li>
<li><span>Are you using the right regster addresses? &nbsp;Are you accessing them as 16bit when they are only 8bit?</span></li>
<li><span>Does the PCB as built match the schematic? &nbsp; Version control is not used as well as often in hobby hardware development as it is in software development. &nbsp;It should be.</span></li>
<li><span>Is your scope or multimeter connected to the write pin? &nbsp;Pin one labeling can often be confusing and it can be hard to count fine pitch pins. &nbsp;Use labeled test points. &nbsp;Don't skimp on annotating your silk screen or use different color breadboard wires in some consistent manner such as red for power, black for ground, blue for IOs, green for clocks.</span></li>
<li><span>Are you assuming a pin is active high when it is relaly active low?</span></li>
<li><span>Are your clocks rising or falling edge?</span></li>
<li><span>If you have a serial bus is it sending LSB or MSB first?</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
